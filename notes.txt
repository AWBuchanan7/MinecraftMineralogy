 Minerology Mod: All common real-work ores, minerals, and gems

Geomes:
like biomes, but for minerals. Sliding scale of igneous <-> metamorphic <-> sedimentary
is a 3D perline noise score binned into 3 catagories
within a geome, a perlin-noise layer stretched in the X-Z plane is used to choose which mineral to use

Minerals (used as stone replacement):
* can be used like cobblestone and smelts into stone
(igneous)
andesite*	✓
vesicular basalt (requires iron pick)*	✓
diorite*	✓
granite*	✓
pummice	✓
rhyolite*	✓
pegmatite*	✓
(igneous ores)
sulphur
(sedimentary)
shale*	✓
sandstone (already in minecraft)	✓
sand (already in minecraft)	✓
conglomerate	✓
dolomite*	✓
limestone*	✓
gypsum (drops 2-4 gypsum powder, which can be crafted with paper into dry-wall and in a block of 4 to make gypsum again)	✓
gravel (already in minecraft)	✓
(sedimentary ores)
phosphorite (drops 2-4 phosphorous)
salt peter (drops 2-4 (sulpher + powdered salt peter + charcoal -> gun powder; phosphate rock + salt peter -> mineral fertilizer)
(metamorphic)
slate*	✓
schist*	✓
gneiss*	✓
(metamorphic ores)
marble
gemstones

Elements (ore) added:
silver (silver ore)
copper (copper ore)
tin (cassiterite ore)
sulphur (sulphur ore)
phosphorous (phosphorite ore)
lead (lead ore)
aluminum (bauxite ore, drops alimuna, smelt alumina with charcoal in crucible to make aluminum ingot)
uranium (uranium ore)
platinum
idirium (osmiridium ore, drops 1-2 osmium dust and 0-1 iridium dust )
osmium (osmiridium ore, see above)
arsenic (asenopyrite ore, using arsenic on a water source block turns it into a poison source block)
mercury (cinnabar ore, 8 mercury + bucket = bucket of mercury, mercury liquid is metallic colored and poisons player)
Tungsten (scheelite ore)
Nickel (garnierite ore)

Nether Ores:
Cold iron (cold-iron weapons deal bonus damage to nether creatures)
Mithral (longer-lasting iron armor)
Adamantine (like diamond for tools and armor, but needs diamond pick to mine it)

Alloys added:
bronze (copper and tin 3:1)
steel (iron and charcoal 8:1)
electrum (gold and silver 1:1)
pewter (tin and lead 8:1)
invar (nickel and iron 1:2)

Gems Added (craft 9 into block):
(precious)
Alaxandrite
Aquamarine
Ruby
Sapphire
(semi-precious)
Apatite (can be crafted into phosphorous)
Topaz
Peridot
Tanzanite
Opal
Zircon
Amethyst
Garnet (use schist texture in BG)
Quartz

Items:
Rock Hammer - pulverizes a (ore) block into its powder form
	plugs into other mods with pulverizers
	hammer needs to be harder than target (iron hammer to pulverize stone to gravel, diamond hammer to pulverize iron ore to iron dust)

Non-Ore Blocks:
Crucible - make metal alloys (shapeless crafting 3x3 grid with fuel slot)
Uranium block - hurts those who touch it, explosion proof (from creepers and TNT)
Dry-wall - made from gypsum and paper, places like glass pane but is opaque, can be dyed
Secret Door - crafted with door and dry-wall, right-click with block to make it render with that block's texture

Villager Trades:
Iron + Coal -> Steel
Copper + Tin -> Bronze
Gold + Silver -> Electrum
3-5 Emeralds -> Steel Rock Hammer
8 ore + 1 Emerald -> 16 ingots
10 Gold Nuggets -> 1 Emerald
12-20 Electrum Nuggets -> 1 Emerald
20-30 Silver Nuggets -> 1 Emerald
10-20 Copper Ingots -> 1 Emerald
1 Ruby <-> 1 Emerald
1 Sapphire <-> 1 Emerald
1 Alaxandrite <-> 1 Emerald
1 Aquamarine <-> 1 Emerald

Achievements
Show how to get each mineral with progression of "XXX prospector: mine YYY -> XXX miner: smelt YYY into XXX"


Notes for other modders:
1. This mod replaces the DimensionProvider for the Overworld, making it incompatible with other mods that do the same (there can be only one provider for each dimension)
2. The new stone types are registerred in the Ore Dictionary as equivalents to stone and cobblestone, so crafting recipes that rely on the Ore Dictionary can use the new stone types without any modification. However, if you added recipies by specifying Blocks.stone, then your recipes won't work with the new stone types. Recipes for crafting vanilla cobblestone (2 gravel + 2 any kind of stone = cobblestone) and stone (smelt gravel) have been added for this reason.
3. Vanilla ore generation has been replaced with Mineralogy's ore generator. Other mod's custom ore generation may or may not work (depending on implementation), but any block can be added as an ore via the Mineralogy config file.
